# Project Title:E-Commerce Dashboard using Power BI 🛍️📊

## Overview 🌟

This assignment involves creating a dashboard for an E-Commerce dataset using Power BI. The dashboard will utilize Data Modeling concepts to provide insightful visualizations and analysis. Key aspects covered in the dashboard include distance-wise customer segmentation, churn rate, average cashback per category, order amount increase vs tenure by city tier, gender distribution, number of devices registered, preferred login device and marital status, hours spent on the app, preferred payment mode and category-wise orders & complaints.

## Dataset Information 📋

The dataset contains information about E-Commerce transactions and customer demographics. Key features include:
- Distance-wise customer segmentation
- Churn rate
- Average cashback per category
- Order amount increase vs tenure by city tier
- Gender distribution
- Number of devices registered
- Preferred login device and marital status
- Hours spent on the app
- Preferred payment mode
- Category-wise orders & complaints

## Dashboard Features 📊

The Power BI dashboard will incorporate the following features:
- Visualizations for distance-wise customer segmentation
- Analysis of churn rate and average cashback per category
- Comparison of order amount increase vs tenure by city tier
- Gender distribution breakdown
- Display of number of devices registered
- Insights into preferred login device and marital status
- Analysis of hours spent on the app
